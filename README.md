To run these projects replace DEVELOPER_KEY with a valid API key which is enabled for the YouTube Data API v3 service. Go to the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/">Google Developers Console</a> to register a new developer key.
You need to create file named "keystore.properties" in the root directory and paste within one line:
> apiKey = "paste_your_api_key_there"
